# Measuring Systemic Risk in the Moroccan Banking Sector: A PCA Approach

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects "Measuring Systemic Risk in the Moroccan Banking Sector: A PCA Approach" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, a PCA approach is followed in order to assess and measure systemic risk in the Moroccan banking sector.

## Prerequisites

All operations, from data preprocessing to systemic risk assessment via PCA, were carried out on ```MATLAB```, version R2021a.

## Theoretical Background

In finance, systemic risk broadly denotes the risk of a cascading failure in the financial sector, caused by linkages within the financial system, resulting in a severe economic downturn. Due to its significant role in financial intermediation, the banking sector is typically the starting point of systemic risk analysis.
